### Love the process, not the end result.

There are a lot of self-help books and blogs that claim that they can help you increase your grit and willpower so that you can turn your wildest dreams into reality. But to truly achieve happiness, you need to be in love with the process of doing something and not the end-result. Then no matter how many obstacles you encounter, you will always overcome them because you love the process of doing that.

We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. If you're in love with a final result, and not the process then no amount of grit or willpower can help you. You will eventually become dissatisfied enough to give up. 

> Happiness comes from solving problems... The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.

True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving. Whatever your problems are, the concept is the same: solve problems; be happy.

### Suffering is good for you.

The key message for me from this chapter was: pain is real, and it is not going away. Pain helps show us what's good for us versus what's bad for us. It helps us understand and adhere to our own limitations. In fact, pain is useful in helping us decide when we need to do something. Suffering is biologically useful - it is nature's preferred agent for inspiring change.

> It's the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that's going to do the most work to innovate and survive.

> Our own pain and misery aren't a bug of human evolution; they're a feature.

> Emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Everybody enjoys what feels good. Everybody wants to live a carefree, happy, and easy life. A question most people never consider is, "What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?"

Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for. This is not about willpower or grit. This is not another admonishment of "no pain, no gain." This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.

> The joy is in the climb itself.

### Problems never go away, they just improve.

Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them. Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one. Don't hope for a life without problems. There's no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.

Mistakes people make: denying problems exist, having a victim mentality (there is nothing they can do to solve their problem). Don't learn new forms of denial exercises and ignore underlying issues. Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he's happy. To deny one's negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems. But, decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks.

### Use your emotions, but not too much

Emotions never last. Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change. If you feel crappy it's because your brain is telling you that there's a problem that's unaddressed or unresolved. Negative emotions are a call to action. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. We should make a habit of questioning them.

I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter! I have a feeling this is the best chapter in the book. After finishing this chapter, I sat down and evaluated the different personal projects I have undertaken. I sorted them into a list of things I like doing because of the process, and another list of things I do because the end-result is very appealing to me.

I have decided to spend more time focusing on the projects that I am doing because I like the process. According to this chapter, I am less likely to give up and more likely to succeed in these projects. For the other projects, I will take some more time and reflect upon why I decided to start working on them in the first place.
